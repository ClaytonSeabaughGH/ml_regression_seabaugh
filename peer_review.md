## Peer Review
This is a review on Aaron Gillespie's [ML Regression Project](https://github.com/aarongilly/ml_regression_gillespie)

### Clarity and Organization
Aaron's project is extremely well organized. I am incredibly impressed by the work they have done.

### Feature Selection and Justification
Aaron's features make a lot of sense. He wants to find the features that help contribute to his "Life Satisfaction". These included active_calories, steps (steps taken), health, work_status, pain, awake_time, etc

### Model Performance and Comparisons
Aaron explains these results/comparisons very well. He had sections that showed what features had a larger impact affecting his life negatively and positively with models to help support. 

### Reflection Quality
Aaron's reflection is exceptional. He does a great job explaining his entire process and motivations in an engaging way.
